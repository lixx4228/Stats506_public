Please divide the roles among the members of the group. You will be in these groups for

assign their role to another member of your group.

If you see 'chat only' in the notes for a group member, please log into 
your umich Gmail account.  Then, have the project manager open a google chat 
for the group.  On the left-hand menu, click the `+` next to
'chat' and then select 'start a group conversation' and add your group members.
Thank you for your cooperation.

### Roles

**Project Manager** - The person in this role should keep the group on task
by asking questions and making sure each member knows their role.
Set up a Google Chat for the group if any members need to participate by
chat only. Help with other roles as needed.

**Editor** - The person in the Editor role should share their screen with the
group as needed during the breakout sessions to demo key steps for other group
members. 

**Record Keeper** - This person in this role should edit the google sheet 
with your group's progress during the breakout sessions. Update a step to "done"
only *after* everyone in the group has completed the step.  

**Questioner** - The person in the questioner role should be prepared to ask the
group's questions when the class reconvenes as a whole. 

## Week 9 - Regular Expression Crosswords

## Part 1

In this activity you will work with your group to solve puzzles involving
regular expressions.  Specifically, you will solve the *intermediate* puzzles
at https://regexcrossword.com/. 

We'll organize this as follows.

1. For each of the 5 puzzles, you'll start in breakout rooms for 6 minutes
   and work to solve the puzzle. 
2. While solving the puzzle, prepare verbal explanations of each square. If
   you're unsure how to explain a square, formulate a question about the
   regular expressions involved instead.
3. We'll reconvene and I'll use a random number generator to pick a group
   to ask a question and/or explain a square or set of squares to the class. 
4. If you finish a puzzle early, feel free to start the next one.

## Part 2

If there is time remaning (10+ minutes) at the end of class, you can use
that to discuss your group project.
