This is a group activity. You can view your assigned group at:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r4OxLjU_oLbVDfyn7y066cc-Qe8HZNBE7zSDRKuoIlY/edit?usp=sharing

Please divide the roles among the members of the group. You will be in these groups for
the remaining acitivites, so please hold each role at most once. If someone is absent, please
assign their role to another member of your group.

If you see 'chat only' in the notes for a group member, please log into 
your umich Gmail account.  Then, have the project manager open a google chat 
for the group.  On the left-hand menu, click the `+` next to
'chat' and then select 'start a group conversation' and add your group members.
Thank you for your cooperation.

### Roles

**Project Manager** - The person in this role should keep the group on task
by asking questions and making sure each member knows their role.
Set up a Google Chat for the group if any members need to participate by
chat only. Help with other roles as needed.

**Editor** - The person in the Editor role should share their screen with the
group as needed during the breakout sessions to demo key steps for other group
members. 

**Record Keeper** - This person in this role should edit the google sheet 
with your group's progress during the breakout sessions. Update a step to "done"
only *after* everyone in the group has completed the step.  

**Questioner** - The person in the questioner role should be prepared to ask the
group's questions when the class reconvenes as a whole.

## Part 1

In this activity you will work with your group to translate between data.table,
SQL, and dplyr expressions in the [week10_translations.R](./week10_translations.R)
file.

We'll organize this as follows.

1. At the start of the activity, we'll randomly assign each of the 14 translations
   to a group.  
1. You'll work on the translations in breakout rooms and prepare a verbal
   explanation for each translation assigned to your group. 
1. We'll reconvene for you to present your group's translation to the class.
   You can choose to screen share or to upload your solution to your Stats506_public
   repo for me to display.
1. We'll divide the 7 questions into ~3 breakout sessions.
