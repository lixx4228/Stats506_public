## Groups

This is a group activity. You can view your assigned group at:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r4OxLjU_oLbVDfyn7y066cc-Qe8HZNBE7zSDRKuoIlY/edit?usp=sharing

Please divide the roles among the members of the group. You will be in these groups for
the remaining acitivites, so please hold each role at most once. If someone is absent, please
assign their role to another member of your group.

If you see 'chat only' in the notes for a group member, please log into 
your umich Gmail account.  Then, have the project manager open a google chat 
for the group.  On the left-hand menu, click the `+` next to
'chat' and then select 'start a group conversation' and add your group members.
Thank you for your cooperation.

### Roles

**Project Manager** - The person in this role should keep the group on task
by asking questions and making sure each member knows their role.
Set up a Google Chat for the group if any members need to participate by
chat only. Help with other roles as needed.

**Editor** - The person in the Editor role should share their screen with the
group as needed during the breakout sessions to demo key steps for other group
members. 

**Record Keeper** - This person in this role should edit the google sheet 
with your group's progress during the breakout sessions. Update a step to "done"
only *after* everyone in the group has completed the step.  

**Questioner** - The person in the questioner role should be prepared to ask the
group's questions when the class reconvenes as a whole. 

## Week 8 - Group Project Proposal

You've all been working very hard. We'll use all of this week and *part* of the
two remaining Tuesday activities to work on the group project. 

## Part 1
1. Create a GitHub repository for the group project and paste a link
   into the Google Sheet.
2. Update your `Stats506_public` repo with links to your group members'
   repos and a link to the repository created in step 1.
3. Discuss the group project and begin to draft your proposal. Try to
   settle on a topic and the computing languages you will use.  Make a
   plan for collaborating.  Post a *draft* of your proposal to the GitHub
   repo before 11:30am.

For full participation credit, after you complete step 3 mark it 'done' on
the progress tracking sheet. I will check that there is a draft of the
proposal.
